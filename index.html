                <p>The effects of human-caused global warming are happening now,<br> are irreversible for people alive today,<br> and will worsen as long as humans add greenhouses gases to the atmosphere.</p>

        <h2><b>Climatic change</b></h2>
        <div class="intro">
            <h4>Climate change is our planet's greatest existential threat. if we don't limit greenhouse gas emmissions from the burning of fossil fuels, the consequences of rising global temperatures include massive crop and fishery collapse, the disappearance of hundreds of thousands of species, and entire communities becoming uninhabitable. While those  outcomes may still be avoidable, climate change is already causing suffering and death.From raging wildfires and supercharged storms, its compounding effects can be felt today, outside our own window.<br>
           <br> Understanding these impacts can help us prepare for what's here, what's avoidable, and what's yet to come, and to better prepare and protect all communities. Even though everyone is or will be affected by climate change, those living in the world's poorest countries-which have contributed least to the problem-are the most climate-vulnearable. They have the fewest financial resources to respond to crises or adapt,and they're closely dependent on a healthy, thriving natural world of food and income. </h4>

            <h1> Impact of Climate change</h1><br>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;"><b>Hotter Temperatures</b></h3>
            <p> Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves; 2020 was one the hottest years on record. Higher temperatures increase heat-related illness and can make it more difficult to work and move around. Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when conditions are hotter.</p>
            <img src="fire.jpg"><br>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;"><b>More severe storms</b></h3>
            <p>Changes in temperature cause changes in rainfall. This result in more severe and frequent storms. They cause flooding and landslides, destroying homes and communities, and costing billion of pounds.</p>
            <img src="flood.jpg"><br>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;"><b>Loss of species</b></h3>
            <p>Climate change poses risks to the survival of species on land and in the ocean. These risks increase as temperature climb. Forest fires, extreme weather and invasive pests and diseass are among many threats. Some species will be able to relocate and survive, but others will not. </p>
            <img src="loss.webp"><br>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;"><b>Poverty and displacement</b></h3>
            <p>Climate change increases the factors that put and keep people in poverty. Floods may sweep away urban slums, destroying homes and livelihoods. Heat can make it difficult to work in outdoor jobs. Weather-related disasters displace 23 million people a year, leaving many more vulnearable to poverty.</p>
